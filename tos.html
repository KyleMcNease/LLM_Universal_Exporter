    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: August 05, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Universal AI Exporter ("we", "us", "our"). By using our extension, website, or services (including mobile/private export features), you agree to these Terms of Service ("ToS"). If you do not agree, do not use our services.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Services Description</h2>
    <p>We provide a browser extension and web tools for exporting AI conversations. All core processing is client-side on your device. Premium features (e.g., mobile share-link processing) may involve optional integrations.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Privacy and Data Handling</h2>
    <p>We do not store, share, or access your conversation data. Everything processes locally in your browser. For optional OAuth (premium/private exports):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You grant limited access via provider login (e.g., OpenAI).</li>
        <li>Tokens are handled securely, anonymized (e.g., remove PII like emails/names), and deleted immediately after use—no retention.</li>
        <li>Risks: Provider API changes may break access; data exposure during auth (e.g., if intercepted)—use secure networks. We are not liable for breaches or changes.</li>
        <li>Opt-in only; disable anytime. Anonymization uses scripts to replace sensitive info (e.g., [EMAIL]).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For pasted/fetched data: Stays in-browser memory; no uploads. If servers are used (future premium), data is encrypted in-transit, processed, and deleted.</p>
    
    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You must comply with AI providers' terms (e.g., no scraping violations). Do not use for illegal purposes. You own your data but grant us limited license for processing.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Disclaimers and Limitations</h2>
    <p>Services "as is"—no warranties. Not liable for data loss, inaccuracies, or provider changes (e.g., if shares become inaccessible). For private exports: Risks include exposure during sharing; we mitigate but cannot guarantee. Limit of liability: $100 or fees paid.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Premium Features</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions auto-renew; cancel anytime. Refunds per policy (7 days).</p>
    
    <h2>7. Changes and Termination</h2>
    <p>We may update ToS (notified via email/site). We can terminate access for violations.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>Delaware law; disputes in Delaware courts.</p>
